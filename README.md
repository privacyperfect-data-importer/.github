## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to facilitate the conversion of data from one format to another, involving multiple steps to ensure accurate and consistent data transformation.

### Project Detailed Steps

1. **Ingest:**

    - Users can upload Excel files or similar formats for importing into the system.
    - These files typically contain 20-30 data points per row.

2. **General Mapping:**

    - The application offers a user-friendly interface for mapping columns in the file to corresponding fields within the application.
    - The importer automatically identifies column headers, even if they are not in the first row.
    - The application suggests mappings based on column headers and supports multiple languages (English and Dutch).

3. **Separator Management:**

    - Many fields are multichoice and can have multiple values.
    - Users can select separators for these fields, and the system can intelligently suggest appropriate separators.

4. **Data Cleanup:**

    - The importer checks for duplicate or potentially duplicate data entries (e.g., "email" vs. "E-mail").
    - Users are presented with options to merge duplicates, promoting data consistency.

5. **Targeted Mapping:**

    - For text fields like legal grounds, the application provides suggestions for general text based on legal qualifications.
    - The system analyzes text and recommends the nearest matching legal article.

6. **Approval and Import:**
    - After completing the previous steps, the sheet is converted into JSON records.
    - New records are created in the target format.
